# Car Data Analysis Project

This project is focused on analyzing a dataset of cars, extracting insights, and visualizing trends. The goal is to explore the relationship between various features such as car brand, model, year, mileage, price, and other attributes.

## Project Overview
In this project, we perform a detailed analysis of a car dataset to uncover patterns and insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations to understand the distribution of car prices, identify trends, and see how different features correlate with the price.

## Features in the Dataset
The dataset contains the following features (columns):
- **region**: Geographic region of the car's listing.
- **price**: The price of the car.
- **year**: Year of manufacture.
- **manufacturer**: Car manufacturer (e.g., Toyota, Ford, etc.).
- **model**: Car model (e.g., Corolla, Mustang, etc.).
- **condition**: The condition of the car (e.g., new, used, etc.).
- **cylinders**: Number of cylinders in the engine.
- **fuel**: Type of fuel used (e.g., gas, diesel, electric).
- **odometer**: Mileage of the car (miles driven).
- **title_status**: The title status of the car (e.g., clean, salvage).
- **transmission**: Type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual).
- **drive**: Type of drivetrain (e.g., front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive).
- **type**: Car type (e.g., sedan, SUV, coupe).
- **paint_color**: Color of the car.
- **state**: The state where the car is listed for sale.
- **posting_date**: The date when the car was listed.

## Key Questions Answered in the Analysis
The analysis addresses the following questions to uncover key insights from the dataset:

1. **What are the average car prices by manufacturer?**
   - Analyzed the average price for each car manufacturer to identify trends and pricing differences between brands.

2. **What is the most commonly used fuel type and how does it affect prices?**
   - Explored the fuel types used by the cars and their impact on price variation.

3. **How does the condition of the car affect the price?**
   - Analyzed how the condition (e.g., new, used) influences the pricing of cars.

4. **What is the relationship between transmission and price?**
   - Investigated whether the type of transmission (automatic or manual) has any significant impact on car prices.

5. **Which regions have the highest and lowest average car prices?**
   - Compared car prices across different regions to identify areas with higher or lower average prices.

6. **What are the most popular types of cars and what is the average price for each type?**
   - Explored the popularity of car types (e.g., sedan, SUV) and analyzed their average prices.

7. **What are the most popular car colors and how do they affect the price?**
   - Investigated how the color of a car influences its price, focusing on the most popular colors.
